          Well. here they are, the tools that I currently use to develop for the
          web. Currently, I am using Fedora Linux 32. With that I am using
          pretty much all FOSS and I am very down for it. Mainly focusing on
          front end type things right now but picking up more and more back end
          things. I always stuck with the idea that a strong foundation is key
          and I followed that. Starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and lately
          moving to coding TypeScript, learning API, and Vue.js/nuxt.js
          frameworks. I dabble in React and Svelte slightly.

              Really liking this distro for a good while now. I never really got
              into Ubuntu much but I do also use Kali Linux and Debian for other
              applications.

              Very powerful framework here. Really decided to venture into
              Vue.js because of the fact it is the most independent big JS
              framework. After getting to know how it works I really like it.
              Worlds of possibity here and nuxt adds much more.

              Another very plesent experience. Tailwind CSS makes writing CSS
              quick for me and I like how it is easy for me to layout pages.
              Many flexable options out of the box and the ability to change
              anything up as you please is great.

              I was weary about getting started with this IDE but I should not
              have been so close minded. Just because it is a Microsoft product
              doesn't mean that very talented people didn't make it. Plenty of
              extensions available and plenty of documentation provides a lot of
              support.

              One of the new areas I am learning about. I really like the

              interesting. Very quick proformance wise and easy way to work that
              simplifies a lot and lets me focus on content and design.
